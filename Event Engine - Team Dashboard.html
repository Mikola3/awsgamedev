<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Unicorn Rentals website provides cryptographically strong hashes as
a service. The system is comprised of a client application and a
standalone server. The system will always return the same hash value for
a given key. The system builds the hash based on a proprietary,
computationally expensive hashing algorithm.</p>
<p>The server is currently deployed as a single, standalone 'go' binary.
There is no session state to track or external calls to make so the
server architecture should respond well to simple horizontal scaling. As
there is expected to be a constrained set of client keys, the system
should respond well to caching techniques. That's it for hints.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>This runbook describes the operational theory and practice for the
production system powering the Unicorn Rentals website. The primary
audience is the DevOps team running the site. The DevOps team is
responsible for deploying code, scaling the site in response to load,
maintaining our published SLA's (including response time and uptime),
disaster recovery, troubleshooting activities and any monitoring and
alerting activities required to meet these objectives.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure-cost">Infrastructure Cost</h2>
<p>Here at Unicorn Rentals we know that it takes money to make money. You
will be charged $8 for every 15 minutes of EC2 usage. For example, if
you have one EC2 instance running for 3 minutes and terminate it, you
will be charged $8. If you have 2 instances running for 13 minutes, you
will be charged $16. So make sure you only provision what you need!</p>
<h2 id="player-dashboard">Player Dashboard</h2>
<p>The dashboard can be accessed by going to <span class="underline"><a href="http://dashboard.awsgameday.io/">http://dashboard.awsgameday.io</a></span>.
 It will prompt you to enter your Team Hash. This team hash can be found
 on the front page of your runbook, or on a piece of paper handed to you
 earlier today. </p>
<p>Once you login to the dashboard, it's time to set your team name. 
Please click on the "Set Team Name" button on the dashboard and enter a 
team name. Keep in mind that this team name cannot be changed once set 
and will represent your team on the scoreboard. The scoreboard team at 
Unicorn.Rentals did not have the motivation to make the scoreboard 
private so keep in mind it is a public site and that team names should 
be created with that in mind. Any inappropriate team names will be 
renamed by the Unicorn.Rentals board of directors.</p>
<p><img src="Event%20Engine%20-%20Team%20Dashboard_files/dashboard1.png" style="width:6.7in;height:8.5in"></p>
<p>The dashboard has a few key components that you will interact with throughout the game.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The top bar of the dashboard has a series of buttons that allow 
you to: 1) Access your score events, 2) Access the scoreboard, 3) Set 
your team name (can only be done once), 4) Request invite to Slack 
channel for team collaboration and chatting, and 5) Access your team's 
AWS account (&lt;-- this is important!)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Below this bar you will see a list of modules enabled for this 
game. Each module can define outputs and inputs. In the example above, 
the module has no outputs, but does have one input. For this module, you
 will provide a URL to your order processor so we can send you order 
(and you can get points).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Below the modules is a list of minigames that your team can 
attempt to play. Each minigame has instructions you need to open in 
order to begin the game and find the answer. Once you have answer, you 
can type it into the answer box and submit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: Once you set your team name, and your team name is approved by 
the UnicornRentals collective, additional options will appear on the 
dashboard. These options include your team score, rank, and trend, as 
well as access to the scoreboard via the "Score Events" button.</p>
<h2 id="score-events-and-scoreboard">Score Events and Scoreboard</h2>
<p>If you click on the “Scoreboard” link on the Player Dashboard, it 
will open a window to the Scoreboard. The Scoreboard is where you will 
be able to track your progress as a team against all the players in the 
room.</p>
<p><img src="Event%20Engine%20-%20Team%20Dashboard_files/scoreboard1.png" style="width:6.7in;height:2.12569in"></p>
<p>To get a deeper view on the performance of your individual team, you 
can click on the "Score Events" button on the player dashboard to access
 your point-by-point breakdown. </p>
<p><img src="Event%20Engine%20-%20Team%20Dashboard_files/scoreevents1.png" style="width:6.7in;height:4.5in"></p>
<p>This page has two sections to pay attention to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Each row lists every score event that your team has generated. 
The "Source" column tells you where the point awards or deductions came 
from. The "Points" column will tell you how many points you got or lost.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The "Reason" column will tell you the reason you got the points 
or lost the points. Pay very close attention to this column when you are
 losing points in order to understsand what is going on and how to fix 
the problems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>The server application is deployed,as a 'go' binary compiled from
source rumored to be stored in a github repository. However, the
name of of this repository is unknown to the current operations and
development staff.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The server application can handle about 5 connections before
starting to get really slow. Be careful about overloading, and watch
for 503s when the queue fills. You can try restarting the app or
server if it starts to get backed up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The server application is an x86 statically linked, unstripped ELF
executable found here:
<a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gameday-classic-resources/server">https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gameday-classic-resources/server</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>The base OS we have chosen is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/">Amazon
Linux</a>. This distribution
was selected for it's broad industry support, stability,
availability of support and excellent integration with AWS. This
distributions was selected by SecOps based on their requirements for
platform hardening.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Architecture was moved to AWS as part of go-to-market plan.
Operating the AWS CLI
(<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html</a>)
is a huge help.</p>
